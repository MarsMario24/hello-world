Mario reporting...  
I really have no idea what the heck I am doing with my life, for I have null experience in coding, however, I am here figuring out what to do.
I have no knowledge related to coding or languages in this field whatsoever, but I hope to learn the essentials (I try to discover if I want to create apps or websites, or something else).
By the way, once being said "languages", I need to stop procrastinating with my French self-taught lessons or I will never properly learn it. Friendly reminder. 
... And practice more English as well.
Over.
